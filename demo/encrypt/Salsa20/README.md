# Salsa20

This challenge is not a true Salsa20 encryption, but merely implements its key generation process in order to familiarizing with some features of Salsa encryption. Facing the real Salsa encryption algorithm, it is possible to use a method similar to RC4 and just directly move to obtain a key stream composed of pseudo-random numbers.
